# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-12-18

This application ("the App") is designed with user privacy as a core
principle. The App does not collect personally identifiable information
(PII). The limited data that is collected is strictly for stability and
functionality.

## Information We Collect

### Crash Data (Firebase Crashlytics)

The App uses **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect crash reports. Crash
reports may include: 
- Device model
- Operating system version
- Technical crash diagnostics

Crash reports **contain no PII**. They are used solely for identifying
and fixing stability issues. The developer has no control over
Crashlytics data, and it cannot be linked back to individual users.

### Mapbox Services

The App uses **Mapbox** for map rendering. Mapbox may collect usage or
diagnostic data under its own policies. This data: 
- Is processed and retained independently by Mapbox
- Is never stored or processed by the App
- Can be opted out of through Mapbox's own settings

### Location Permission

The App may request location access strictly with explicit user
consent.
Location data: 
- Is used only for map‑related features
- Is not stored, transmitted, or analyzed by the App
- Is not linked with any crash or analytics data

## Strava Integration

### Authorization

The App allows users to upload compatible activity types to **Strava**.
To do this, the user must: 
- Log in to Strava
- Explicitly authorize the App to upload activities on their behalf

Default Strava visibility settings apply to all uploaded activities.

### Data Handling

The App stores your Strava **refresh token** securely and only on your device
in encrypted storage, using a randomly generated key within the OS-provided
sandbox. The token is used exclusively for Strava authentication and is never
shared or accessed by the App for other purposes.

After upload, Strava may use activity data according to its own
analytics, retention, and processing policies.

## Data Export and Backup

The App provides an option to export all app data to a new device (iOS
or Android).
When using this feature: - The user is solely responsible for how they
transfer and handle the backup file
- The exported backup **is not encrypted**
- The App assumes the device is not rooted/jailbroken, and therefore all data
inside the App's sandbox remains protected by the operating system

**Only the Strava refresh token is encrypted.**
All other recorded data remains unencrypted within the device's sandbox
unless exported by the user.

## How The Data is Used

Data collected through Crashlytics is used exclusively for: 
- Diagnosing technical issues
- Improving stability and performance

No user behavior is tracked or analyzed except in the context of a crash
report.

## Third‑Party Services

The App uses: 
- **Firebase Crashlytics** (Google LLC)
- **Mapbox**
- **Strava API** (for authorized uploads)

Users should review each service's own privacy policy for their
independent data practices.

## GDPR Compliance

### Legal Basis and Data Control

The App does **not store personal data on any servers**. All data
remains on the user's device unless the user explicitly uploads to
Strava.
Crashlytics data is anonymized and controlled entirely by Google, and
the developer has no ability to identify, or delete it.
Uploaded Strava activities are controlled by Strava.
Mapbox usage data is controlled by Mapbox.

### User Rights

Under the GDPR, users in the European Union have rights regarding
personal data **only if it is held by the App**.
Since the App does not store personal data: 
- The developer cannot identify and therefore delete crash reports per user.
- App is not authorized to do any operations with Strava account except for activities uploading.
    Deletion of activity or changing of visibility settings should be handled in Strava account.
- Mapbox data: the App includes default Mapbox info icon to access Mapbox Privacy Policy link
    and Mapbox Telemetry menu to control settings. Developer does not have any control over these settings.
    User decides whether to share telemetry data or opt out.

For local data on the device, the user controls it entirely, including
any exported backups.

### Data Transfers

Crash data and Strava interactions may involve transfers processed by
Google and Strava according to their respective GDPR compliance
frameworks.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed toward children and collects no personal
information from any user.

## Data Retention

Crash data is retained by Firebase according to its own retention
schedule.
The App itself stores no retained analytics or tracking data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. The latest version will
always be available at this URL.
